# Main Goals 

- Investigate one component at a time how to rewrite
- Learn basics of Rust by doing
- The end goal is to have my [C++ Snake game](https://github.com/Reiventsu/Cpp_Projects_Experiments/tree/master/Projects/Games/SnakeGame) with raylib running in Rust with the Rust raylib binding.

This is an experimental attempt at simply rewriting code I've already made
into Rust.

I am not quite happy with how this turned out even if it is functional.
