# Rusty-stuff
A repository for Rust projects. This one mimics my [C++ Projects repository](https://github.com/Reiventsu/Cpp_Projects_Experiments)
it is focused on Rust however instead and I'll create a similar directory theme here.  
The Experiments folder will mainly contain things that aren't complete or polished just things for me to see how they work.
The Projects directory is for things that are more polished, well-thought-out and complete.
